The goal of abslife is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of abslife like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("lcgodoy/abslife")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(abslife)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can
include R chunks like so:

```{r aloans}
data(aloans)
summary(aloans)
```
