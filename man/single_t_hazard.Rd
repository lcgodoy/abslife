\title{Hazard estimate for a single time-point.}
\usage{
single_t_hazard(t, trunc_time, time_to_event, event, censoring)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A time point at which hazard estimates are sought.}

\item{trunc_time}{A numeric vector representing the observed left-truncated
time.}

\item{time_to_event}{A numeric vector representing the observed time to
event.}

\item{event}{event indicator}

\item{censoring}{An indicator for censoring (1=censored, 0=not). Defaults to
a vector of 0s if \code{NULL}. An observation is only treated as an event if
status=1 AND censoring=0.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the time to event, \eqn{\hat{C}_n}, the number
of events, and the hazard estimate along with its standard error.
